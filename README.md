# Regarding the state of Sniper/Snipebot

Hey everyone, sorry to inform you guys, but Sniper will be discontinuing. Why? 

- The main library I have been using to write Sniper is now terminating (discord.py), and I can't run Sniper anymore. I either have to rewrite Sniper completely in a different language (I'm only proficient in python) OR I have to use a different library which I also have to rewrite Sniper for.

- The more people that use Sniper, the more I will have to pay for hosting (I don't make money from Sniper). Sniper has been gaining too many servers too quickly. (As of now it has 2,664 total servers.) Additionally, since Sniper has crossed the 2.5k server threshold, there are additional responsibilities of which I have to follow in order to continue running Sniper (including sharding).

- Discord is implementing many features of which I don't like. For one, verified bots for some reason, recieve worse treatment than a non-verified bot would. I was denied bot privileges simply due to the fact that Sniper is verified. Discord is also requiring all bots include slash commands (tl;dr, I have to not only rewrite Sniper in a completely new library/language, but I have to make sure it has slash command integration, otherwise Sniper won't be able to run)

- I'm simply not motivated to work on Sniper anymore, it's been almost a year since release, I was planning to update it several times but I was simply demotivated. I want to get to move on to different projects other than discord bots. 

I will be releasing ALL code for Sniper (even my unfinished code I was planning to release) although, unless you rewrite it, it will be useless. 

Thanks for using Sniper and sorry to everyone!
